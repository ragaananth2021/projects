This tool will automatically analyze the support bundle (~2G in size) collected from the customer SDN controller. The tool will run multiple checks and the output will include a log file that shows specific details about errors, potential issues etc...

Eg:  
-The switches with continuously incrementing i2c errors and the timeframe when maximum errors happened  
-The switches with errors under ofad-debug logs  
-The switches and their model number, uptime, ASIC, connection duration and role  

etc...
